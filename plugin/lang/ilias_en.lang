solution#:#Solution

paramvalues#:#Test values
paraminfo#:#The learner-supplied function is compared to the above solution by executing it with the given values. For each line here, if the returned values are the same, points are added to the studentâ€™s score. For functions that require more than one parameter, separate values by commas (,).  You can use several testing values in a single line, only giving points if all tests succeed. To do so, separate sets of parameters by semi-colons (;). E.g., to test a function f(int a, String b) using two sets of values, you can enter: 3,"foo";4,"bar"
solutioninfo#:#This function should return the same values that you want the learner's function to return. Note that the actual code is NOT compared, only the return values. You can test your function using the parameters below by clicking "Save and Compile".
