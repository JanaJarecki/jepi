# Grading Server

The grading server is the backend of JEPI, the Java Exercise Plugin for Ilias.

## Requirements

You need to have the following software installed:
- Gradle, a build tool for java.
- Java 8, as the server uses lambdas. Note that it does not need to be the systems default java. It only has to be configured and set in the bash you are starting the server.

## Simple Instructions

You need to have the requirements installed. Then follow the steps:

- Adapt setup.sh to your needs.
- Setup your environment by executing '''source setup.sh'''
- Build the server running '''build.sh'''
- Start the server by calling '''run.sh''' . This script takes an optional parameter, the port the sever listens on.
